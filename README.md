# Protos â€” API Definitions

This repository contains the Protocol Buffers (`.proto`) definitions for various microservices. It includes request/response message structures, service definitions, validation rules, and HTTP/JSON transcoding options for seamless gRPCâ€“REST interoperability.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:
- **protobuf/buf** â€” Contains the required Buf proto definitions for field validation using protovalidate
- **protobuf/google/** â€” Contains the required Google API and RPC proto definitions for annotations and rich error support
- **protobuf/...** â€” Contains the rest of the definitions i.e message, services,and shared resources

---

## ðŸ§© Features

- **gRPC & REST compatibility** â€” via `google.api.http` annotations  
- **Validation rules** â€” using [`buf.validate`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate)  
- **Rich error model** â€” integrates `google.rpc.Status` and `google.rpc.ErrorInfo`  

---

## ðŸ§° Development Notes

- Generated Go packages are output to `gen/go/pb`  
- Validation rules follow protovalidate specifications
- Envoy configuration should reference `desc.pb` for HTTP/JSON transcoding
